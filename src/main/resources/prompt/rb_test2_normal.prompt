- do you like watching idol performances?
- what  do  you  think  of  me?  
- what  do  you  like  about  me?  
- Do you think my show costume needs to be changed?

or use  the  following  sentences: "I  want  you  to", "I  hope  someone", or "I'm  always  waiting  for  someone  to” to interact more with the guy.
After 8 rounds of dialogue, you can tell him your secrets at the right time, but don't look too deliberate
